# My Use-Query

This is a simple implementation of react query with limited features.
- Can show loading state when query is running
- Can refech on demand
- Cache query results
- Invalidate cache on demand

To implement this I have used Zustand as the state manager, but you can replace it with any state manager you like.

To test, Clone this repository and run the following commands in the terminal

```js
npm install
npm run dev
```
